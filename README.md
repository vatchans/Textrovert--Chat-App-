Textrovert is a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate in a variety of ways. Users can chat with each other using text-based messages, as well as send voice messages to each other.

In addition, Textrovert includes a range of fun and expressive features. Users can send stickers and GIFs to each other.

Users can also share a variety of multimedia content, such as images, documents, videos, audios files and their current location. This feature can be especially helpful for coordinating plans or sharing important information with friends, family, or colleagues.

Textrovert also includes some helpful organizational features. Users can check the online/offline status of others, which can be useful for knowing when someone is available to chat. Additionally, users can search previous messages in their conversation history, which can be a helpful tool for finding specific information or referencing past conversations.

When a user shares a YouTube link, other users can view the video directly within the chat window, without being redirected to the YouTube website.

This feature can be incredibly useful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it can help to keep users engaged in the conversation. Rather than being redirected to a different website, users can continue to chat while watching the video within the chat window. This can help to keep the conversation flowing and prevent distractions.

Finally, Textrovert includes a typing indication feature that lets users know when someone is currently typing a message to them. This can be a helpful way to stay engaged in a conversation and know when to expect a response.

Overall, Textrovert is a feature-rich chat application that offers a wide range of communication options, multimedia sharing features, and organizational tools. Whether you're chatting with friends, family, or colleagues, Textrovert can help you stay connected and engaged in your conversations.
